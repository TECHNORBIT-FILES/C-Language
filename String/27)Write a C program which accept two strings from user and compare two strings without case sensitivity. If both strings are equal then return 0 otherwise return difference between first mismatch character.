/*Write a C program which accept two strings from user and compare two strings without case sensitivity. If both strings are equal then return 0 otherwise return difference between first mismatch character.
Eg:
Input String1: india Is mY cOuntry 
Input String2: INDIA is MY countrY 
Output: Both strings are  equal.
