16)Write a C Program to Find 2 Elements in the Array such that Difference between them is Largest. (Using Dynamic Memory Allocation)
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
void main()
{
	int* p = NULL;
	int i, n, max = 0, min = 0, diff = 0;

	printf("enter the number of element you want in array:\t");
	scanf_s("%d", &n);
	p = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		scanf_s("%d", (p + i));
	}
	min = *(p);
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		if (max < *(p + i))
		{
			max = *(p + i);
		}
		if (min > *(p + i))
		{
			min = *(p + i);
		}
	}
	diff = max - min;
	printf("the largest diff elemnt in array =%d\n", diff);
}
